We were learing about API's in my coding class.  This was my first attempt at building a very basic weather app using React + Vite.

you will need to create a .env file and use this API key to be able to check the weather for a specific city.  Add this code to the .env file...  VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY = c1e9f0538a4ed569cdc28ee373aaeccb
